# My amazing DND game
## It is the Crushing bug game in which you can drag and drop the puzzle parts into their suitable places.
There was some bugs that needed to be fixed and following are the bugs that are fixed and are now able for user to perform while playing.

• Dragging the puzzle from the drop zone back to puzzle board, this will now be able for user
to drag and drop.

• User will be able to only drag one correct puzzle to the drop zone which is meant to be the
correct position for that puzzle. Example, if the user will drag the image that is not correct for
the place it will not be placed to that position and when the correct puzzle gets into its
position it will be fixed to the puzzle smoothly.

• when user will click on the picture preview, all images in the drop zones will be
Removed and it will be reset. (reset function)
